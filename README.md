# About

This project was created for the purpose of practicing my react skills. The main component of this project is the JWT login authentication feature and the extensive backend.
The frontend is very basic, but it should demonstrate enough knowledge of CSS/HTML/JS/React and a responsive design. I am aware there are a few design bugs here and there, it is because that was not the focus of this project.
Though overall the project should still look nice and behave like a normal webpage.

## `npm install`

Installs the npm packages.

### `npm run start`

Runs the frontend on localhost:3000


### `npm run dev`

Runs the backend on localhost:8080

If cloning this repo, you will also need to install the packages for the backend, and create a .env file in the /server folder with these parameters:

ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET=INSERTTOKEN

REFRESH_TOKEN_SECRET=INSERTREFRESHTOKEN

DATABASE_URI=INSERTDATABASEURI

### Credits
To give credit where credit is due, I used the material I found in https://github.com/gitdagray github in order to build the backend. You will find many references to modern functional components in there.
